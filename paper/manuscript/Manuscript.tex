\begin{abstract}
	\added{We downscale the cost-effective heat supply of different European decarbonization scenarios generated by the aggregate model GENeSYS-MOD from the national to the community level in Austria. The remaining European CO\textsubscript{2} budget (and related CO\textsubscript{2} prices) of the 1.5°C climate target is considered in the values to be downscaled. The results show, among others, that district heating covers parts of the heat demand in four of the thirty-five sub-regions in Austria in 2050. The district heating networks are located in densely populated areas with high heat demands and are supplied by geothermal, synthetic gas, hydrogen, and waste. Not all of these networks reach the heat density required for economic and technical efficiency from today’s techno-economic perspective and industry benchmarks. The identified heat density gap, mainly driven by lower heat demands, can be reduced and even closed by an optimal allocation of large-scale heat pump generation into district heating. We conclude that district heating networks still reach economic viability in 2050.}

\section{Current Austrian heat market}\label{appendixC}
\added{Table \ref{tab:numbers} provides an overview of the Austrian heat market in 2017. Particularly, the proportion per heat source/generation technology on the total heat demand for space heating and hot water is shown. Note that the absolute number of households supplied by heat pumps and solarthermal is in total 294,075 (see row 6 in the table). According to \cite{statisitik2016}, the total heat production from district heating was around} \SI{24}{TWh} \added{in 2016. Thereby, the share of renewable energy was 45\%. Besides, the share of waste sources was 9\%.}

\section{Illustration of the benchmark indicator value}\label{appendixB}
Figure \ref{fig:app:method} shows an illustrative example of the iterative downscaling algorithm (Algorithm 2). It shows two different conditions of a simple graph. In the first condition ($i$), the network topology consists of four nodes (A-D) and four lines. It is shown in the subfigure in the top left. The table below (bottom left) shows the amount of \replaced{district heating}{centralized} and on-site heat supply as well as the indicator value for each node. Note that the numbers are only for illustration. Node A has the lowest indicator value (see marker [1] in the left table) and, therefore, its amount of \replaced{district heating}{centralized heat supply} (marker [2]) is reallocated to the remaining nodes of the network (marker [3]). This process increases the on-site heat supply accordingly at node A as this node is not connected to the network in condition $i+1$ and increases the amount of \replaced{district heating}{centralized heat supply} at nodes B-D (see the larger nodes in the top right subfigure). The heat demand of node A in condition $i+1$ is covered only by on-site heat supply. Node A is removed from the graph and thus disconnected from the network.

\section{Heat density for varying allocation of heat pump generation into district heating}\label{Appendix:D}
\added{Figure \ref{fig:sens} shows the heat density of the district heating network in Graz (AT221) in the \textit{Directed Transition} scenario. On the x-axis, the amount of district heating is shown. District heating in the \textit{Directed Transition} scenario includes synthetic gas and waste only. The corresponding heat density is indicated by the black circle (top). The range between the two dotted lines marks the heat generation by heat pump (air) units. The left dashed line indicates heat pump (air) generation if used exclusively on-site (i.e., small-scale heat pump (air) units). Similarly, the right dashed line indicates heat pump (air) generation if used exclusively in district heating (i.e., large-scale heat pump (air) units). Each point between the two dashed lines corresponds to an individual split between small- and large-scale heat pump (air) units. The maximum heat density of} \SI{10.9}{GWh \per km^2} \added{is reached by a share of two-thirds of large-scale heat pump (air) units feeding into district heating while one-third is on-site.}
