\begin{abstract}
	\added{We downscale the cost-effective heat supply of different European decarbonization scenarios generated by the aggregate model GENeSYS-MOD from the national to the community level in Austria. The remaining European CO\textsubscript{2} budget (and related CO\textsubscript{2} prices) of the 1.5°C climate target is considered in the values to be downscaled. The results show, among others, that district heating covers parts of the heat demand in four of the thirty-five sub-regions in Austria in 2050. The district heating networks are located in densely populated areas with high heat demands and are supplied by geothermal, synthetic gas, hydrogen, and waste. Not all of these networks reach the heat density required for economic and technical efficiency from today’s techno-economic perspective and industry benchmarks. The identified heat density gap, mainly driven by lower heat demands, can be reduced and even closed by an optimal allocation of large-scale heat pump generation into district heating. We conclude that district heating networks still reach economic viability in 2050.}

\section{Current Austrian heat market}\label{appendixC}
\added{Table \ref{tab:numbers} provides an overview of the Austrian heat market in 2017. Particularly, the proportion per heat source/generation technology on the total heat demand for space heating and hot water is shown. Note that the absolute number of households supplied by heat pumps and solarthermal is in total 294,075 (see row 6 in the table). According to \cite{statisitik2016}, the total heat production from district heating was around} \SI{24}{TWh} \added{in 2016. Thereby, the share of renewable energy was 45\%. Besides, the share of waste sources was 9\%.}
