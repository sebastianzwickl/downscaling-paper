\begin{abstract}
	Achieving the \SI{1.5}{\degreeCelsius} climate target requires, among others, a sustainable transformation of the heat supply. We downscale different European decarbonization scenarios of the heating sector to the Austrian grid level, using tailor-made downscaling techniques accounting for infrastructure requirements of renewable heat sources and the topology of centralized heat networks. We demonstrate that district heating networks are crucial in the highly efficient decarbonized heat supply in Austria in 2050 and identify eight different representative district heating networks, supplying heat demand between \SI{0.6}{} and \SI{12}{TWh}. Nevertheless, seven of these networks do not reach the heat density required for economic and technical efficiency from today's techno-economic perspective. We conclude that the decarbonization leads to centralized heat networks with lower heat densities.

\section{Further methodology illustrations}\label{appendixB}
Figure \ref{fig:app:method} shows an illustrative example of the iterative downscaling algorithm (Algorithm 2). It shows two different conditions of a simple graph. In the first condition ($i$), the network topology consists of four nodes (A-D) and four lines. It is shown in the subfigure in the top left. The table below (bottom left) shows the amount of centralized and on-site heat supply as well as the indicator value for each node. Note that the numbers are only for illustration. Node A has the lowest indicator value (see marker [1] in the left table) and, therefore, its amount of centralized heat supply (marker [2]) is reallocated to the remaining nodes of the network (marker [3]). This process increases the on-site heat supply accordingly at node A as this node is not connected to the network in condition $i+1$ and increases the amount of centralized heat supply at nodes B-D (see the larger nodes in the top right subfigure). The heat demand of node A in condition $i+1$ is covered only by on-site heat supply. Node A is removed from the graph and thus disconnected from the network.
