\begin{abstract}
	The core objective of this work is to downscale European deep decarbonization scenarios of the heating sector to the Austrian community level in 2050 to obtain an estimation of future demand for different heating technologies on smaller geographical scale. We use tailor-made downscaling techniques accounting for infrastructure needs of heat sources, the network topology of centralized heat networks, and population density. The results show that centralized heat networks play an important role in the highly efficient heat supply of densely populated areas in 2050. However, the projected heat density of supply areas is significantly lower than today despite high connection rates (in average greater than \SI{85}{\%}). We identify a heat density gap of at least \SI{7.42}{\frac{GWh}{km^2}} considering \SI{10}{\frac{GWh}{km^2}} as today's minimum required value. We conclude that future yes/no decisions of centralized heat networks should take enhanced account of the highly efficient use of sustainable and local heat sources in addition to the achievable heat density. Policy-makers should incorporate the development of lower heat densities resulting from decarbonization measures in the benchmarking of centralized heat networks efficiency.
